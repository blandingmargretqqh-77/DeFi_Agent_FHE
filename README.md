# FHE-powered AI Agent for DeFi Portfolio Management

Discover a game-changer in the world of decentralized finance: an autonomous AI agent designed to manage your DeFi investment portfolio, all while ensuring your financial data remains confidential through **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. This innovative approach allows the AI to learn and make decisions based on your encrypted financial data and risk preferences without the need for manual intervention.

## The Problem: Navigating the complexities of DeFi

Managing a decentralized finance portfolio can be overwhelming. Users often struggle to keep up with market trends, optimize investments, and manage risks effectively. Traditional portfolio management requires constant monitoring and manual adjustments, which can lead to missed opportunities and suboptimal performance. Furthermore, users are increasingly concerned about the privacy and security of their personal financial data. As DeFi expands, the need for an intelligent, automated solution that prioritizes user privacy has never been more critical.

## The FHE Solution: Smart decisions made simple

The solution lies in leveraging **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, which allows computation on encrypted data without exposing it. By utilizing **Zama's open-source libraries** such as **Concrete**, the **TFHE-rs**, and the **zama-fhe SDK**, our AI agent can process your encrypted financial data directly while maintaining your privacy. This means the AI can make informed investment decisions and rebalancing strategies without ever accessing your raw data.

In practice, this provides the following advantages:
- **Privacy-first approach**: Your financial data never leaves your device in an unencrypted format.
- **Autonomous decision making**: The AI agent learns from your preferences, optimizing your portfolio automatically.
- **Real-time adjustments**: The AI can rebalance your portfolio and engage in yield farming as needed, maximizing returns while adhering to your risk tolerance.

## Core Functionalities of the AI Agent

- **FHE Encryption of User Data**: Securely encrypts all financial data using Zama's technology.
- **AI-Driven Investment Strategies**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to make data-driven investment decisions without human input.
- **Automated Rebalancing & Yield Farming**: Automatically adjusts your portfolio based on market conditions and user-defined preferences.
- **User-Focused Control**: Users can revoke permissions at any time, maintaining ultimate control over their investments.
- **Dashboard Monitoring**: A user-friendly interface to configure the AI agent and monitor its performance.

## Technology Stack

- **Smart Contract**: Solidity
- **Decentralized Frameworks**: Hardhat / Foundry
- **Confidential Computing**: Zama FHE SDK (Concrete, TFHE-rs)
- **Frontend**: Node.js, React (or similar)
